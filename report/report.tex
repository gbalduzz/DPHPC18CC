\begin{abstract}
We present an improved parallel implementation of a tree based connected components algorithm originally
introduced in 1984 by U. Vishkin. To improve the algorithm's performance the graph's edges are
distributed across multiple cores. Each process computes in a lock-free manner a local forest representing the different
connected components. The resulting forests are then combined using a reduction. A comparison of our
algorithm against a communication avoiding algorithm recently developed at ETH, on a set of large graphs
($5\times10^8$ Edges with up to $2\times10^7$ Vertices), is presented. Results where our algorithm uses a
mixture of both MPI and OMP are also shown.
\end{abstract}

\section{Experimental Results}\label{sec:exp}

\input{results.tex}

%Here you evaluate your work using experiments. You start again with a
%very short summary of the section. The typical structure follows.
%
%\mypar{Experimental setup} Specify the platform (processor, frequency, maybe OS, maybe cache sizes)
%as well as the compiler, version, and flags used. If your work is about performance,
%I strongly recommend that you play with optimization flags and consider also icc for additional potential speedup.
%
%Then explain what kind of benchmarks you ran. The idea is to give enough information so the experiments are reproducible by somebody else on his or her code.
%For sorting you would talk about the input sizes. For a tool that performs NUMA optimization, you would specify the programs you ran.

%Next divide the experiments into classes, one paragraph for each. In each class of experiments you typically pursue one questions that then is answered by a suitable plot or plots. For example, first you may want to investigate the performance behavior with changing input size, then how your code compares to external benchmarks.
%
%For some tips on benchmarking including how to create a decent viewgraph see pages 22--27 in \cite{Pueschel:10}.

%{\bf Comments:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Create very readable, attractive plots (do 1 column, not 2 column plots
%for this report) with readable font size. However, the font size should also not be too large; typically it is smaller than the text font size.
%An example is in Fig.~\ref{fftperf} (of course you can have a different style).
%\item Every plot answers a question. You state this question and extract the
%answer from the plot in its discussion.
%\item Every plot should be referenced and discussed.
%\end{itemize}

%\begin{figure}\centering
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{dft-performance.eps}
%  \caption{Performance of four single precision implementations of the
%  discrete Fourier transform. The operations count is roughly the
%  same. The labels in this plot are maybe a little bit too small.\label{fftperf}}
%\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}

\input{conclusion.tex}

%Here you need to summarize what you did and why this is
%important. {\em Do not take the abstract} and put it in the past
%tense. Remember, now the reader has (hopefully) read the report, so it
%is a very different situation from the abstract. Try to highlight
%important results and say the things you really want to get across
%such as high-level statements (e.g., we believe that .... is the right
%approach to .... Even though we only considered x, the
%.... technique should be applicable ....) You can also formulate next
%steps if you want. Be brief. After the conclusions there are only the references.

\section{Future Work}

\input{future_work.tex}

%Here we provide some further tips.

%\mypar{Further general guidelines}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item For short papers, to save space, I use paragraph titles instead of
%subsections, as shown in the introduction.
%
%\item It is generally a good idea to break sections into such smaller
%units for readability and since it helps you to (visually) structure the story.
%
%\item The above section titles should be adapted to more precisely
%reflect what you do.
%
%\item Each section should be started with a very
%short summary of what the reader can expect in this section. Nothing
%more awkward as when the story starts and one does not know what the
%direction is or the goal.
%
%\item Make sure you define every acronym you use, no matter how
%convinced you are the reader knows it.
%
%\item Always spell-check before you submit (to us in this case).
%
%\item Be picky. When writing a paper you should always strive for very
%high quality. Many people may read it and the quality makes a big difference.
%In this class, the quality is part of the grade.
%
%\item Books helping you to write better: \cite{Higham:98} and \cite{Strunk:00}.
%
%\item Conversion to pdf (latex users only):
%
%dvips -o conference.ps -t letter -Ppdf -G0 conference.dvi
%
%and then
%
%ps2pdf conference.ps
%\end{itemize}
%
%\mypar{Graphics} For plots that are not images {\em never} generate the bitmap formats
%jpeg, gif, bmp, tif. Use eps, which means encapsulate postscript. It is
%scalable since it is a vector graphic description of your graph. E.g.,
%from Matlab, you can export to eps.
%
%The format pdf is also fine for plots (you need pdflatex then), but only if the plot was never before in the format
%jpeg, gif, bmp, tif.


% References should be produced using the bibtex program from suitable
% BiBTeX files (here: bibl_conf). The IEEEbib.bst bibliography
% style file from IEEE produces unsorted bibliography list.
