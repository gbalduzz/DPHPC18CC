abstract = "There are many imaging modalities (e.g., medical imaging scanners) that capture information about internal structures and generate three-dimensional (3D) digital images of the distribution of some physical property of the material of the structure. Such images have been found to be very useful in analyzing the form and function of the structure and in detecting and correcting deformities in the structure. Visualization of 3D structures is an essential component of such analyses. One commonly used approach to visualization consists of identifying the structure of interest, forming its surfaces, and then rendering the surfaces on a two-dimensional screen. This paper addresses the surface formation problem assuming that object identification has already been done and a 3D binary image is available that represents the structure. For the existing 3D boundary tracking algorithms, the user has to somehow specify each surface that is to be tracked. Often, the 3D image consists of many surfaces of interest. Their manual specification is very tedious and may be impossible if the structure is of complex shape. This paper describes a methodology for automatically tracking all boundary surfaces—i.e., labelling boundary surfaces—in the given 3D image. The algorithms also generate additional information from which the 3D connected components in the image are trivially obtained. Examples from medical imaging are included to illustrate the usefulness of the new methodology."

abstract="This paper contains a systematic analysis of a natural measure theoretic notion of connectedness for sets of finite perimeter in ℝN, introduced by H. Federer in the more general framework of the theory of currents. We provide a new and simpler proof of the existence and uniqueness of the decomposition into the so-called M-connected components. Moreover, we study carefully the structure of the essential boundary of these components and give in particular a reconstruction formula of a set of finite perimeter from the family of the boundaries of its components. In the two dimensional case we show that this notion of connectedness is comparable with the topological one, modulo the choice of a suitable representative in the equivalence class. Our strong motivation for this study is a mathematical justification of all those operations in image processing that involve connectedness and boundaries. As an application, we use this weak notion of connectedness to provide a rigorous mathematical basis to a large class of denoising filters acting on connected components of level sets. We introduce a natural domain for these filters, the space WBV($\Omega$) of functions of weakly bounded variation in $\Omega$, and show that these filters are also well behaved in the classical Sobolev and BV spaces.",

abstract = "An algorithm for connected component labeling of binary patterns using SIMD mesh connected computers is presented. The algorithm consists of three major steps: identifying exactly one point (seed point) within each connected component (region), assigning a unique label to each seed point, and expanding the labels to fill all pixels in the respective regions. Two approaches are given for identifying seed points. The first approach is based on shrinking and the second on the iterative replacement of equivalent labels with local minima or maxima. The shrinking algorithm reduces simply connected regions into single pixels, but multiply connected regions form rings around the holes contained in the regions. A parallel algorithm is developed to break each such ring at a single point. The broken rings are then reduced to single pixels by reshrinking. With iterations consisting of shrinking, breaking rings, if any, and reshrinking, each pattern (of any complexity) is reduced to isolated points within itself. In the second approach every region pixel in the image is initially given a unique label equal to its address in the image. Every 3 × 3 neighborhood in the image is then examined in parallel to replace the central label with the maximum (or minimum) of the labels assigned to the set of region pixels in the neighborhood. This is done iteratively until there is no further change. The seed points are then the locations where the pixel addresses match their converged labels. A parallel sorting method is used for assigning a consecutive set of numbers as labels to the seed points. Parallel expansion up to the boundaries of the original patterns then completes the connected component labeling. The computational complexities of the algorithm are discussed."
